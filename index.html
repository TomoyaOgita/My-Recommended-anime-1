    <h1>My Recommended anime</h1>
    <h3>I want to recommended anime. The anime is "Jyujyutu kaisen(呪術廻戦)”.
    </h3><img src="Jyujyutukaisen.jpg" alt="poster of Jyujyutukaisenn" />
    <p>"Jujutsu Kaisen" is a Japanese manga by Gege Akutami. Serialized in "Weekly Shonen Jump" (Shueisha) from the 14th issue of 2018. The atmosphere is very gloomy and dark because the theme is "curse". It is characterized by a very tense style because people die calmly. However, there are relatively many gag elements that are sandwiched between the character's actions and dialogue.In the anime, the first period was broadcast from October 3, 2020 to March 27, 2021. The second period is scheduled to be broadcast from 2023.<br>
      On December 24, 2021, "Theatrical Version Jyujyutsu Kaisen 0" was screened in Japan.</p>

    <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen's song</h2>
    <h3>Kaikaikitan</h3><img src="Kaikaikitann.jpg" alt="poster of Kaikaikitan" />
    
    <p>"Kaikai Kitan" is a song by Eve.  It has been appointed as the first cool opening theme song of the TV anime "Jujutsu Kaisen". The content of this song was very close to the world view of the work. Although esoteric phrases are used here and there, it is also very attractive that they express the mysterious world of the work. Buddhist terms are used here and there, and I think that the lyrics strongly express the desire to "sing" instead of "recite" that Eve himself said.</p>

    <p>The lyrics are filled with "one-off" feelings that express the relationship between the main character, Yuta Otobone, and Rika, and the melody has a sense of speed. And in the reverse dream, it is a ballad of the whole body that is paired with "one way", and I think that the bond that we are together for a long time while thinking about each other is strongly expressed."Ichizu" and "Sakayume" were appointed as the theme song and ending theme of the animated movie "Theatrical Version Jyujyutu kaisen 0" released in theaters on December 24, 2021, respectively.The composer has sent a message that "everything is like a chorus".</p>

    <h3>King gnu</h3><img src="King-gnu.jpg" alt="poster of King gnu" />
    <p>King Gnu members call their music "Tokyo New Mixture Style". It seems that these words have a strong intention that those who have been influenced by listening to various music will make exciting sounds that transcend the boundaries of genres in the big city of Tokyo. In 2017, the band name was changed from Srv. Vinci to the current King gnu. It was formed around the current leader, Daiki Tsuneta. The band's name is "Gnu", which has the habit of gradually merging from spring and eventually becoming a huge flock, and it was named from the desire to involve men and women of all ages and become a large flock.</p><h4>King Gnu | Spotify</h4>
